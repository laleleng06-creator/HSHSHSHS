                        <strong>HI BABYY.</strong>
                        <p>
                         Sawakas na tapos din HAHAHAHA. Anyways, honestly, I didn’t think making HTML would be this tough. When I watched the tutorial, it looked so easy! But I was way off after a lot of trial and error, I finally figured out how it works.

Honestly, this is the first time I’m writing a letter like this for my lover, and I’m not really sure what to say. You know I’m not great with words or expressing how I feel, which is why I usually show my love through my actions.

But even if I can’t always find the perfect words, please believe me when I say I love you more than I can ever explain. It’s something so deep and real, bigger than anything I could ever put on paper.

Thank you for being patient with me, for loving me exactly as I am, and for making my life better just by being in it. I hope this little letter brings a smile to your face, just like you always bring one to mine.

Love you so much, baby.
